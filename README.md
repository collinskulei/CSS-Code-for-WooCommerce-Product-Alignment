# CSS-Code-for-WooCommerce-Product-Alignment
Explanation of Key Styles:
Grid Layout for Product Listings:

The display: grid; on the .woocommerce ul.products ensures that the products are displayed in a responsive grid layout.
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr)); ensures that each product item occupies a minimum of 250px, but can grow to take up more space if needed. This is ideal for responsiveness.
Product Styling:

Each product item has some padding, a light border, and a subtle shadow on hover for better separation.
The product title is given a fixed height and overflow: hidden; to ensure consistency and avoid breaking the layout when titles are too long.
Product Image Consistency:

Images are set to be 100% wide to fit the container and are given a max-height: 300px; to ensure consistency across product listings.
Product Price and Button Styling:

Prices are styled to stand out with a red color and bold font weight.
The "Add to Cart" button has a blue color that turns darker on hover for better interactivity.
Responsiveness:

The CSS includes a media query for smaller screens (max-width: 768px) that adjusts the grid layout, product padding, and font sizes to ensure the layout looks good on mobile devices.
